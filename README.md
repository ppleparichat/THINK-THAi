# THINK-THAi

Welcome to the THINK-THAi website repository! This website is a project that I have created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its purpose is to provide information about my freelance Thai teaching services to foreigners.

You can visit the website by clicking [here](https://ppleparichat.github.io/THINK-THAi/) or visit the deployed version at [www.think-thai.com](http://www.think-thai.com). The website serves as a platform to showcase my teaching expertise and connect with potential clients interested in learning the Thai language.

## Features

- **HTML:** The website is built using semantic HTML, ensuring proper structure and accessibility.
- **CSS:** Styling and visual enhancements are achieved through CSS, creating an appealing and user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript:** I have implemented JavaScript functionality to add interactivity and dynamic elements to the website, enhancing user experience.
- **Services:** The website provides information about the Thai teaching services I offer, including course details, lesson formats, and pricing.
- **Canva Designs:** In addition to web development, I have also created custom designs using Canva to enhance the visual appeal of THINK-THAi. These designs include graphics, images, and promotional materials that complement the website and effectively communicate the essence of Thai language learning.
- **Contact:** Visitors can easily get in touch with me through the provided contact information, enabling direct communication for inquiries or booking lessons.


The website is an ongoing project, and I plan to further develop it with additional features and enhancements using various frameworks in the future. Stay tuned for updates!
